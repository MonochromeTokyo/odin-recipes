# odin-recipes
I will be creating a webpage about some of my favorite recipes or recipes I would like to try. 
I will be using the foundational HTML concepts and skills.
I will use skills that demonstrate building multiple pages, linking them, and putting text + pictures on them.
Post project:
I created a total of 4 pages. 1 Being the main page and the other 3 being  recipe pages. In all three pages i either an unordered list or ordered list was used.
All pages except the main page had an image embedded on them.
It was a fun project.
I also used git to clone, add, commit and push the repository.
